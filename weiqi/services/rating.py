    Game results are bundled into rating periods as recommended in the glicko2 paper.
    The results are stored for each user and kept until the end of the rating period, after which they are reset.

    Rating periods are simulated for each user individually in order to avoid having to update all users at once.
    In addition, to provide real-time rating updates, after each game the users rating will be recalculated based on
    the data of the current period.
    Note that this is done on a clone to preserve the results and only the actual rating is copied back.

    Handicap is handled by altering the opponents rating before calculation, adding or removing rating points
    relative to the handicap.
