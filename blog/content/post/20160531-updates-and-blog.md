weiqi.gs now has it's own blog. Here I will publish updates about changes, features and the current development
of weiqi.gs

With a bit more than a week since the first public release there have already been several improvements and fixes:

- Some basic sounds have been added for passing/timing/game started
- Private chats can now be closed again
- Basic notification when there are new chat messages
- Automatic linking of URLs in chat
- Info dialog for open games
- Game info for demo games can now be edited
- Several minor fixes in the UI
