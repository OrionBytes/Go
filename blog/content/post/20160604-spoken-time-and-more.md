A few more additions and fixes have made it to weiqi.gs, one of which is a spoken countdown to help players when they are low on time.

Some other improvements include:

- Hotkeys for demonstration tools
- Custom profile text for users with markdown support
- A better visual indicator when profile settings have been saved
- Fix for some clipping issues for user context menues
- Other minor refactorings and changes
